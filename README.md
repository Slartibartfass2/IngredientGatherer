# IngredientGatherer
A small program which gatheres ingredients from recipes from different websites and adds them together to create a shopping list.

At this time, this program supports recipes from:
- KptnCook (https://www.kptncook.com/)
- Nora Cooks (https://www.noracooks.com/)

It is used to copy the text from the textarea into Google Keep to create a shopping list.
